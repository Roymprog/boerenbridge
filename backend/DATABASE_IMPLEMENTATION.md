# Database Schema Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed: Step 2 - Database Schema and Models

### Database Schema Design
Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema for the Boerenbridge scorekeeping application with the following tables:

#### Tables Created:
1. **players** - Stores player information
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (Unique)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)

2. **games** - Stores game configuration and metadata
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)
   - `max_cards` (Integer, 5-17)
   - `status` (Enum: active, completed, abandoned)

3. **game_players** - Association table linking games and players
   - `game_id` (Foreign Key to games)
   - `player_id` (Foreign Key to players)
   - `position` (Integer, 0-based clockwise seating)

4. **rounds** - Stores round configuration
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `game_id` (Foreign Key to games)
   - `round_number` (Integer, 1-based)
   - `cards_count` (Integer, cards in this round)
   - `dealer_position` (Integer, 0-based dealer position)

5. **round_scores** - Stores individual player scores per round
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `round_id` (Foreign Key to rounds)
   - `player_id` (Foreign Key to players)
   - `bid` (Integer, player's bid)
   - `tricks_won` (Integer, actual tricks won)
   - `score` (Integer, calculated round score)
   - `running_total` (Integer, cumulative score)

### SQLAlchemy Models
- ✅ Created all 5 models with proper relationships
- ✅ Defined foreign key constraints and indexes
- ✅ Used Enum for game status
- ✅ Added proper SQLAlchemy relationships and cascading deletes

### Pydantic Schemas
- ✅ Created comprehensive request/response validation schemas
- ✅ Implemented proper field validation with min/max values
- ✅ Created separate schemas for Create/Response/Summary operations
- ✅ Added complex validation for round data submission

### Database Connection & Configuration
- ✅ Set up SQLAlchemy database connection with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Configured session management with dependency injection
- ✅ Added environment variable configuration
- ✅ Created database connection utility functions

### Alembic Migrations
- ✅ Initialized Alembic migration system
- ✅ Configured Alembic to use our models and environment variables
- ✅ Created initial migration script with all tables
- ✅ Successfully applied migration to create database schema

### CRUD Operations
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive CRUD classes for all models:
  - `PlayerCRUD` - Player management operations
  - `GameCRUD` - Game creation and retrieval with filtering
  - `RoundCRUD` - Round and score management
  - `ScoreCalculator` - Scoring logic implementation
  - `ScoreboardService` - Complex scoreboard generation

### API Endpoints
- ✅ Created complete REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /players` - Fetch all players for dropdowns
  - `POST /players` - Create new players
  - `POST /games` - Create new games with validation
  - `GET /games/{game_id}` - Get game details
  - `GET /games` - Get game history with filtering/sorting
  - `POST /games/{game_id}/rounds` - Submit round data
  - `GET /games/{game_id}/scoreboard` - Get current scoreboard

### Scoring Logic Implementation
- ✅ Correct bid scoring: 10 + (2 × tricks_won)
- ✅ Incorrect bid scoring: -2 × |bid - tricks_won|
- ✅ Running total calculation across rounds
- ✅ Automatic winner determination

### Testing & Validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Verified database connection and all CRUD operations
- ✅ Tested scoring calculations with various scenarios
- ✅ Validated scoreboard generation
- ✅ Confirmed API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Successfully tested with FastAPI automatic documentation

## Key Features Implemented:
1. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and validation
2. **Scoring System**: Accurate implementation of Boerenbridge scoring rules
3. **Game Flow**: Support for complete game lifecycle from creation to completion
4. **Flexible Querying**: Advanced filtering and sorting for game history
5. **Real-time Scoreboard**: Dynamic scoreboard generation with running totals
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation at multiple levels
7. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## Next Steps:
Ready to proceed to **Step 3: Basic API Endpoints** (already partially completed) or move to **Phase 2: Core Frontend Components**.

The backend foundation is solid and ready to support the full Boerenbridge application!
